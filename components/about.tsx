			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>
				Formerly an entrepreneur, I decided to pursue my passion for programming
				and enrolled in a coding bootcamp where I studied full-stack software
				engineering. My favorite part of software development is its
				problem-solving aspect. As a big fan of puzzle games, I love the feeling
				of finally figuring out a solution to a challenge. My core stack
				includes React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL. I'm also proficient with
				Vue.js, Next.js, MongoDB, AWS, and other technologies, and I'm always
				eager to learn something new. When I'm not coding, I enjoy exploring
				Tokyo, discovering new places, capturing moments with my camera, and
				tuning in to educational podcasts.
