# Personal Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio, a modern web application built with React & Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and hosted & managed on AWS.

## Features:

1. **Next.js & React**: Fast rendering and interactive UI.

3. **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework, used for rapid UI development.
4. **Framer Motion**: A powerful animation library to enhance user experience.
5. **AWS Services**:
   - **Amplify**: For building and deploying the web app.
   - **Lambda**: To run serverless functions.
   - **API Gateway**: To manage and control the API calls.
